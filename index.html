              Bangladesh slips further in Global Innovation Index | The ...
              Bangladesh has been making progress in innovation, but its
              performance is still lower than many other countries. The
              country's innovation efforts include inventions, initiatives, and
              awards.

              needs without compromising the ability of future generations to
              meet their own needs. This includes efforts to protect natural
              resources, ensure fair labor practices, and promote economic
              benefits.

              investments in infrastructure in recent years, but there is still
              a need for more. So, Bangladesh need more and more manpower.
